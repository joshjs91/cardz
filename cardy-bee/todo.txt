Games to handle:
- Skull
- snap

Features:


- add winner to gamestate using condition function inside game condition that tells you who won.
    - could possibly make it so that the winner is calculated a different way to how the game is ended. means you could mix winning and game type
- make DTOs instead of passing around the real game state - todo
- handle cards only visible to certain users - todo
- make it so that the card is provided as an attribute of an action opposed to just a random attribute i need to validate - done (a while ago)
- make it so for discard card effect, it allows you to provide how many cards are discarded. - todo
- resolve the game ending as an attribute - done
- convert actionHanlders to work the same way as effects i.e. can remove PlayerAction its a redundant wrapper. there is only ever one handler per action as well - done
- change it so their are card types and the attributes are on there i.e. colour - done
